# File-Compression-Techniques-Project

## Compression Algorithms Implemented

1.) Run Length Encoding

2.) LZ77

3.) LZSS

4.) Huffman Encoding


## Helper Class

It has many important functions also note that to cal_compression() we need to pass size of input and output file as long as passing a complete file to it will be costlier so in each algorithm file we need to calculate that.
